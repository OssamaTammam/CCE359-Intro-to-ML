## Data Classification
Given the MAGIC gamma telescope dataset. This dataset is generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The dataset consists of two classes: gammas (signal) and hadrons (background). There are 12332 gamma events and 6688 hadron events. We are required to use this dataset to apply different classification models such as Logistic Regression and KNearest Neighbor (K-NN). We are also required to tune the parameters of these models and compare the performance of models with each other.
